            <p>The language of Python is extremely powerful and very advanced for web design and development. Developers with this skill are in great demand, but it is difficult to find a high-quality web development company that uses Python for web development. There are many web development and design languages a company can use, but Python is the best programming language out there because it is so advanced and complex.</p>
            <p>Because it is such a difficult language to use, developers who are skilled at creating a website with Python tend to want higher salaries. This means that most web design companies just can’t have full-time programmers. Generally, only large web design companies can afford having Python web programmers on staff full-time.</p>
            <p>Python programming yields an advantage over other programming languages when it comes to highly functional programming, which is a must-have for websites and applications in 2021. With its ongoing development, Python is the perfect language to cover the challenges that businesses face every new day. Python programmers take advantage of its versatility to provide efficient solutions that meet the requirements of business owners in the USA. To ensure that, Python developers keep learning new tricks for creating modern websites through its powerful community.</p>
            <p>The prevalence of web development with Python is why the big web development companies out there, such as Google and Facebook, are so difficult to compete with. Instead, the average web development company in Denver or Philadelphia uses a WordPress template and has a PHP programmer modify it to suit their clients’ needs. This PHP programmer is usually someone who already works at the company, or the firm outsources the project to an individual in another country such as India. The web development company will then sell the final product as a “custom-designed website.” Although this is a deceptive practice, it happens every day. Check out our previous articles to learn more about problems with sites like Wix and WordPress.</p>
            <p>At Direct Line Development, our strategy is different. We only use the most knowledgeable developers who know and use the best programming languages out there to build a website with Python. Our results showcase our developers’ talents and the excellence of our clients’ Austin, Denver, and Philadelphia-based businesses. Let’s look at some of the reasons you should choose web development with Python.</p>
            <h1 id="anchor"><strong>WHAT IS PYTHON USED FOR IN WEB DEVELOPMENT?</strong></h1>
            <p>Developers in different fields use Python for various things, including web development, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Using Python for websites will help you compete with giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft because they all use the programming language.</p>
            <h2>WHAT IS PYTHON?</h2>
            <p>Python is an adaptable and highly efficient programming language. This is because Python for websites offers dynamic typing capabilities. This versatile programming language lets developers create scientific applications, system applications with graphics, games, command-line utilities, web applications, and so much more. Every time we create a website with Python, it is high-functioning and very successful.</p>
            <p>Another benefit of creating a website with Python is that you can use and distribute it for free. Python is known as an open-source product, which means you can get all the coding information you need on the Internet. Other open-source products include Perl, Apache, and Linux. Also, copying, embedding, and distributing Python in your products is unrestricted. This makes it extremely useful in the world of digital systems, which is important for your business because it gives you flexibility in the marketplace by allowing your company to interact with industry sectors. Ultimately, this will help your business be successful for a long time to come.</p>
            <p>Python is a well-known software that is used everywhere. Many small companies and developers rely on it, and companies like Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Intel all have websites built with Python. Besides the big companies, different development fields use Python for website development as well.</p>
            <h2>HOW WEB DEVELOPMENT FIELDS USE PYTHON</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web development:</strong> Web development relates to creating, deploying, and operating all applications and programming interfaces on the Internet. We can use Python for web development to create web-based applications. Generally, we use a combination of Python and JavaScript to accomplish this.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine learning:</strong> Machine learning helps computers take in data without being programmed. Python is used to set up the computer, and the language is incorporated throughout its learning process.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI):</strong> AI is used to quickly and efficiently analyze and process large amounts of data. It can be used to give personalized suggestions to potential customers. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for AI.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep learning:</strong> This is part of AI, and its goal is to process data in a way similar to that of the human brain. Python for web development allows developers in this field to work with robotics and image recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet of things:</strong>Python helps devices like cameras and games connect to the Internet quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remaining adaptive in today’s fluid marketplace will ensure your company’s success and longevity.</p>
            <h1 id="anchor1">IS PYTHON GOOD FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT?</h1>
            <p>Python is known and used around the world. Hundreds of thousands of developers and businesses use Python for web development. Huge companies like Red Hat, Yandex, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook all rely on Python. JetBrains developed PyCharm, which is the most popular integrated development environment for Python. According to JetBrains, web development is second only to machine data analysis.</p>

                <figcaption> Most developers use Python primarily for web development and machine learning.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>According to the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a>, for the second year in a row, Python is the programming language in the highest demand. This means that Python is the programming language that developers say they want to learn. So, why use Python for web development?</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/f2.wide.png">
                <figcaption> This diagram shows the most in-demand programming languages. As you can see, Python is at the top of the list.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h1 id="anchor2">WHY DO WE PREFER USING PYTHON FOR WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT?</h1>
            <p>Developers who know how to build a website with Python are in such high demand because Python is a powerful and highly advanced programming language. However, it is extremely difficult to find a good web development company in the Denver, Philadelphia or Austin areas that use Python for website creation. Of course, there are many other programming languages that developers can choose to use. But because Python is one of the more advanced and complex languages in the world of website design and development, programmers who know Python come with heftier salary demands. Unfortunately, the average web design company cannot afford to pay these developers’ annual salaries, which means that only large companies can usually pay for projects to make a website with Python.</p>
            <p>This is why smaller companies tend to find it so difficult to compete with larger companies, like Microsoft and Facebook, who have websites built with Python. Usually, web designers in Denver and Philadelphia download WordPress templates and modify them slightly. This is typically accomplished via a PHP programmer who either works in-house, or the work is outsourced to a company in another country such as India. This template is then sold at a high price as a “custom-designed” website. While this manipulation should not be legal, it happens daily. We have already written several articles on problems with websites like Wix and WordPress, so feel free to check them out.</p>

            <p>At Direct Line Development, we do things differently. We give you a truly customized website by using only the best developers who know the languages in the highest demand today. Our results help our clients’ businesses shine and showcase our teams’ skills. Python web development allows us to do this.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Easy to learn and use:</strong> Compared to other programming languages, Python is one of the easiest to learn and use. Because it is relatively short, using Python for web development and debugging it is not difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>Perfect for building prototypes:</strong> Because the language is easy to access, it is not difficult to ensure that the program works properly. You can build prototypes to test out the code.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> Python was not originally created to fulfill a need. Because of this, its structure is not specific. Instead, it can integrate with several other programming languages.</li>
                <li><strong>Fantastic frameworks:</strong> Python can use many different frameworks for building apps and websites. This saves you the tedious task of having to start from scratch.</li>
                <li><strong>Versatile and runs on every platform:</strong> Whether you are developing a website or managing cloud infrastructures, Python web development can perform numerous functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Django </strong>– the ultimate weapon for Python: Django is a framework of Python. Python web development with Django allows web developers to skip getting started and instead focus on parts of their application that are new. Django has the most features of any framework out there.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Despite the abundance of frameworks for Python, we mainly use Django.</p>

            <h1 id="anchor3">WHY DJANGO AND WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH PYTHON WEB DEVELOPMENT?</h1>
            <p>Django is a backend framework of Python, and it is used to create high-level websites. Python web development with Django allows developers to focus on creating their websites, without starting from the beginning. Not only is Django the most universal and functional Python language in 2019, but it is also one of the top 10 most popular frameworks in the world. This is because Django web development with Python is quick and easy to use, very secure, works on any number of web application projects, and has been around for a long time.</p>
